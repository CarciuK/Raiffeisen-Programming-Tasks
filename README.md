## Raiffeisen_TA_Problem1 (version1)

This solution follows the Page Object Model (POM) testing method, providing a well-structured testing environment, cleaner and easier-to-follow scripts, more comprehensive test results and allows for easier maintenance and extensibility. It includes the following components:

- TestCases

In this folder you will find a subfolder named "Pages" and a class named "TestCases".

- Pages

Within this folder is located the HomePage class which includes essential locators and methods that are used according to the testing task.This approach facilitates seamless navigation and provides a great testing environment.
    

- Test Cases

The "Test Cases" class includes the test for the given task named "IFrame_Editing_Text". This test class utilizes a method from the HomePage class and it ensures readability and produces accurate results.


## Raiffeisen_TA_Problem1_version2

This solution presents a simpler unit test example for the given task. The testing method, locators, and assertions are incorporated within a single thread line, which is located inside the TC_1 class. This model is suitable for small-scale testing scenarios and follows a linear flow of execution.
